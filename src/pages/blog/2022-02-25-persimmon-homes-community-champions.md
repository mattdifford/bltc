Tennis club celebrates ace donation

Bridgwater Tennis Club has received a financial boost to build on its sessions for people who want to reengage with the sport.

The club, which has been located on a site at Junction 24 of the M5 for more than 20 years, has bagged £1,000 from Persimmon Homes.

The donation comes through the housebuilder’s Community Champions scheme.

Each month Persimmon donates up to £64,000 to good causes across the UK.

Bridgwater Tennis Club will use the funding to employ coaches for its Rusty Racquets sessions, which offer a chance for people to try or restart tennis.

Diane Woosley, Vice-chair of the club, said: “We’re thrilled to receive this generous funding from Persimmon Homes.

“As Bridgwater is recognised as having areas of deprivation, we would love to be able to expand our Rusty Racquets venture.

“These sessions are helpful as they provide social interaction and cover a wide range of ages from the unemployed, the lonely and the shift workers up to and including the older generation, all of whom appreciate learning or improving their skill on the tennis court along with the physical andmental benefits of exercise.

“Expansion of these sessions needs financial help for coaching including suitable exercise advice to develop skills which would improve a sense of well-being and achievement.”

Carly Spear, Sales Director at Persimmon Homes Severn Valley, said: “We’re delighted to be able tosupport Bridgwater Tennis Club with this money. 

“This is a great, expanding club which is looking to create new sporting opportunities for a wider range of people.

“We wish the club well with its Rusty Racquets venture.”

Persimmon Homes is currently building new homes in Bridgwater at Westminster Walk on Kingsdown Close and Chaucer's Meadow on Taunton Road. For more information, visit www.persimmonhomes.com
