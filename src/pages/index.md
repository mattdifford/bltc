We are a welcoming club situated just off Junction 24 of the M5. This makes us an ideal location to cover a wide area and not just Bridgwater.

We have a wide range of membership and playing options, including a recently introduced Pay and Play (weekends/ weekday afternoons (Friday extension)

We aim to cater for all standards of players from beginner to county standard and beyond.
